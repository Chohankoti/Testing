The command python -m pytest -v -s is used to run tests using the pytest framework in Python. Here's what each part of the command does:

python: This is the Python interpreter command used to execute Python scripts.
-m pytest: This part tells Python to run the pytest module as a script.
-v: This flag stands for "verbose" and instructs pytest to display more detailed information about the tests being run, including individual test names and their outcomes.
-s: This flag stands for "no capture", which means that pytest will not capture the output of the tests, allowing you to see any print statements or output generated by the tests directly in the console.
